### Breakout Variation Ideas

### Interesting Existing Game Variations

 * Game 1

 Super Breakout is one of the variations I'm most familiar with.  I think having a variety of timed power-ups generally makes the game more replayable and interesting, since power-ups can be randomized which makes replaying through the same level more interesting depending on the power-ups that are dropped.  It also allows for some creativity in the designing the power-ups.
