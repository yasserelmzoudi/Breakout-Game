## Team Roles and Responsibilities

 * Team Member #1: Jack Ellwood

 Worked primarily on implementing the Brick and PowerUp abstractions and their concrete classes.  Also implemented the Paddle and Display classes.

 * Team Member #2


## Design goals

The goal for this project was to make a playable game of Brick Breaker that can easily be added on to through the use of abstractions and subclasses.  Ultimately, we've created a base game that can have new features added while adding as litle code as possible.

#### What Features are Easy to Add

New power-ups, bricks, and levels are, in particular, easy to add. The abstract Brick and Power-Up abstractions make adding new bricks and power-ups as subclasses relatively easy, and levels can be added as a textfile by simply following the naming convention of "levelN.txt", where N is the level number.
